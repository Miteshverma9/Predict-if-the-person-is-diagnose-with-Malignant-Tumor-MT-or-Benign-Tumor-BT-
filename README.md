Machine Learning - Supervised - KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) Model.
Task is to Predict if the person is diagnose with Malignant Tumor(MT) or Benign Tumor(BT).
Using KNN Machine Leaning Model.
KNN is also known as lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.
KNN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
Libraries used in this model - Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SelectKBest, f_classif, Standard scaler, Train test split, Grid Search CV, Cross Validation score, KNN classifier, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.
